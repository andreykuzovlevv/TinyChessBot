* **Solve once â†’ save**:

  ```
  tinyhouse solve --out tinyhouse.tb
  ```

  This explores the full Tinyhouse game tree from start position, proves the game-theoretic result, and writes a table file with solved outcomes.

* **Load and use** (instant answers, no re-solving):

  ```
  tinyhouse play --tb tinyhouse.tb
  # then at the prompt:
  startpos
  bestmove
  ```
